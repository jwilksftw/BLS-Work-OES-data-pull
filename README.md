# BLS-Work-OES-data-pull
This program was made for a special project I was given at work. The Occupational Outlook Handbook (www.bls.gov/ooh)
only provides national-level data on wages. This team was tasked with determining if there would be value
in providing state and local data in addition to national-level data. There are 820 detailed occupations, 
so I felt it was necessary to have a program pull data so that we could make a data-driven decision. 
The OES5.py program pulls data from the Occupational Employment Statistics branch of BLS and calculates how much employment is concentrated
in the top 5 employing cities for each of the 820 detailed occupations. This gave us an idea of how many occupations
would be improved from the addition of more localized data, as the national level picture we painted could be 
misleading. 

My team was able to get it's final proposal approved and the state and local data will be added soon.
